# Math_module_any_complex_nthdegree_polynomial
The module was developed and tested on 3  million equation with any order of equation ,ex: ([2x3-3*y/6-(20*z)]/3*x]

# Once compiled ,the program will ask for input string with "please insert the mathematical equation"
ex:(2+6*8/2+4-2)    with braces
# now the program can be tested for mathematical equation
with +,-,* and /  with multiple braces 
# Please create a module for processing batch job of thousand of equation.
